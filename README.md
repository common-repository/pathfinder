This is Pathfinder plugin for WooCommerce

== Description ==

Pathfinder is a plugin that does email marketing FOR YOU.
 
If you are looking for an easy & fast way to increase your sales, this might be it. Simply install our plugin and Pathfinder will:

* build email marketing campaigns for you
* segment your customers for you
* write & design your emails in the unique style of your store (make all the edits you want)
* report back and find improvements to grow your store further
 
It's like adding a top-class digital employee to your marketing team. It studies your data, crafts ideas, then implements and refines them FOR YOU. Pathfinder is any marketing team's "secret weapon", and it's suitable for both small teams who don't have enough hours in the day, as well as larger teams who want a killer edge over their competition.

= Fully Automate Your Email Marketing =

You can give several marketing jobs to Pathfinder. Set up in just a few clicks, Pathfinder takes full responsibility for the job, designs marketing materials to custom fit your brand, and makes continuous improvements over time.
 
Of course, you’ll always get final say over what goes to market, and you can change anything Pathfinder builds for you. But the idea is that Pathfinder will do most of the heavy lifting and save you a bunch of time, money & effort. All that’s left is to run final checks and push it live. Here’s what Pathfinder can take on for you:

* Acquire new customers
* Convert window shoppers
* Reduce abandoned checkouts
* Increase customer happiness & referrals
* Upsell customers after a purchase
* Reduce lost customers
* Design promotions
* Write newsletters
 
= The New Way vs. The Old Fashioned Way =

In reality, most e-commerce marketing teams fail to implement marketing automation because:

* Marketing teams are too busy
* Implementation is too complicated
* It takes too long to set up and manage
 
= With Pathfinder: =

* Everything is done for you 
* No technical skills necessary 
* Campaign creation takes minutes not months.
 
This is not about telling you how to do it or giving you a bunch of templates to customize. Pathfinder is a completely new type of marketing product that makes the idea of doing all the work yourself on traditional platforms seem dated and cumbersome. Make the switch today & you'll never look back!
